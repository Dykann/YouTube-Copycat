# YouTube

In order to demonstrate my abilities to reproduce any website mock-up (<strong>interface</strong>) <br>
I chose to re-create from scratch 3 three famous social media: <strong> YouTube, Netflix and Facebook </strong> <br>
The current one <strong> YouTube </strong> is <strong> Responsive</strong> and in <strong> Dark Theme </strong> <br>
I Integrated it with: <strong> HTML and SASS</strong>
